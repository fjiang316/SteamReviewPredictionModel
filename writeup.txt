explaination:
Task 1 (Would Play Prediction): 
For this task, I used two models (the BPR model and the popularity model) to predict. I implemented a BPR model with Tensorflow by training it with one positive interaction from the training set, and one negative interaction I generate randomly (by taking the same user and a game the user has not played yet in dataset), and train the model so that the positive interaction should have a higher score than the negative interaction I generated randomly.
Then, I iterate through the test set to give a prediction score with BPR model for each user,game pair, and store the score in a dictionary corresponding to the user. Since we know in advance that the test set is like the validation set in which exactly half of the interactions will be positive and the other half negative for every user in it, I use a popularity model in which I see if the BPR score is in the above half of all scores one user get, if it is in top half, I predict positive (1), else if it's in the bottom half, I predict negative (0).

Task 2 (Time Play Prediction):
For this task, I used the f(u, i) = alpha + beta u + beta i model extended from homework 3 with regularizers. I solved for the objective function for each term (alpha, beta u, beta i) and iteratively update the values of those terms with the equations to minimize the objective (basically alternating least square). Since we try to focus on validation set, I also implement an early stopping in which I calculate the mse on validation set every iteration and stop iterating once the difference in changes of mse is less than 0.0005. I also used different lambda regularizers for beta u and beta i (to have sort of L2 normalization implemented).
